## A better way to track your timetable.

BetterTimetable is a small project developed by myself after encountering a bit of a problem, I couldn't track my timetable, it was inconvienient having to use work arounds to track it in a way that didn't over complicate it. This is my solution.

Constantly updated, this will scale up as I work on it. Considering there's still alot to do, expect alot of updates.

### Update: Update 0.2 delayed.
I kind of expected it but, I'm delaying 0.2 because I couldn't get config and setup OR username done.
Because of this delay research can be done and a better update can come out. Kind of sucks that it had to come to this but I'm commited to pushing this out. **If it DOESN'T come out on 2/28 then I'll be switching languages, no more snake :(**
```markdown
Update Board:
===> BetterTimetable 0.2 Preview branch added, EXTREMELY unstable.
===> 0.2 Delayed a week.
```
### Alpha 2: The next stage of BetterTimetable

BetterTimetable is getting better. Here's a highlight of the features coming up at 02/28.
```markdown
--> New Setup Process. Improving the UX.
--> Actually configuring the timetable from the command line instead from the code itself.
--> And general fixes and improvements.
```

*But it's still currently 0.1.2, this is just a preview of 0.2 coming 02/28*

### Extremely early in Development

This is nowhere near finished and I'll guarantee you that a **SEVERE** lack of *features* and *bugs* are to be expected.

### Problems?
Let me know so I can sort out any bugs I've left out. https://github.com/rootinstinct/
