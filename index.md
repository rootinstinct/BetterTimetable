## A better way to track your timetable.

BetterTimetable is a small project developed by myself after encountering a bit of a problem, I couldn't track my timetable, it was inconvienient having to use work arounds to track it in a way that didn't over complicate it. This is my solution.

Constantly updated, this will scale up as I work on it. Considering there's still alot to do, expect alot of updates.

### Alpha 2: The next stage of BetterTimetable

BetterTimetable is getting better. Here's a highlight of the features coming up at 02/16.
```markdown
--> New Setup Process. Improving the UX.
--> Actually configuring the timetable from the command line instead from the code itself.
--> And general fixes and improvements.
```

*But it's still currently 0.1.2, this is just a preview of 0.2 coming 02/16*

### Extremely early in Development

This is nowhere near finished and I'll guarantee you that a **SEVERE** lack of *features* and *bugs* are to be expected.

### Problems?
Let me know so I can sort out any bugs I've left out. https://github.com/rootinstinct/
