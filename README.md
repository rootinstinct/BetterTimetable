# BetterTimetable: Alpha 2
BetterTimetable is a python program made to help you keep track of your timetable, it's been developed over a while with it being fleshed out progressively. Alpha 2 is the next evolution of BTT being built from the ground up.
## Never Lose Track
BetterTimetable is made to keep you on track throughout the whole of the day, open source and free, it can be used by anyone (willing to of course) that needs a helping hand in tracking their subjects, it keeps improving, so we'll keep track so that you can stay on track.
## Revival
BTT went on a LONG hiatus without any updates, I ended up archiving it as it seemed as if I couldn't get it right. With this release of Alpha 2, a milestone is set and a future for even more to come is on it's way, it's only the beginning.
### From the ground up.
Alpha 1's formatting was a obstacle for updating it, as well as the fact with just a generally flawed design. Now you can actually read the code.
```
#   First Time Setup [FTS]

if cfgstatus == ['fts0']:
    print("Starting First Time Setup...")
    time.sleep(1)
    input("First Time Setup ready, press any button to get started.\n")

#   Phase One:
#   Username

usersetup = open('username.txt', 'w')
with open('username.txt', 'w') as usersetup:
    username = input("We best get started with your name. Type out your name.\n")
```
### First Impressions are everything.
First Time Setup allows you to get setup and get on with it. Five minutes is all thats needed to never lose track.
```
#   First Time Setup [FTS]

if cfgstatus == ['fts0']:
    print("Starting First Time Setup...")
    time.sleep(1)
    input("First Time Setup ready, press any button to get started.\n")

``` 
### The future.
Made with the future in mind, it took a whole rebuild to move to Alpha 2. It's made so that doesn't have to happen again. We're just getting started.

## Updated on a irregular basis
It is what it is :)
## Very Early in Development
Bugs and a *severe* lack of features should be expected.
