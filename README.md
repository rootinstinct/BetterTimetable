# BetterTimetable
A simple Python program that helps you track your timetable. Initially this was just a small idea I had, but I've decided to scale it up a bit adding new features over the course of time. It's also known (not really known in the first place like only 2 people know about this) to have a developer that struggles to get his software past 0.2, could change soon o-o
## Don't Lose Track.
BetterTimetable is made to keep you on track throughout the whole of the day, open source and free, it can be used by anyone (willing to of course) that needs a helping hand in tracking their subjects, it keeps improving, so we'll keep track so that you can stay on track.
## 0.2 Launch Update.
Newer, shinier, coded in a way that's actually readable, 0.2 has alot going and the development is going full steam ahead, no launch date can be given yet but I'm aiming for by the end of next month at least. Might come sooner than that, but no promises (like seriously no promises this could go on a 2 month hiatus again for all i know mate). \
By the time it's there, you can expect a full UX overhaul (also literally a full overhaul as this is built from the ground up) with First Time Setup and a much better foundation for the future. It is pretty pogchamp :D
## Updated on a irregular basis
It is what it is :)
## Very Early in Development
Bugs and a *severe* lack of features should be expected.
