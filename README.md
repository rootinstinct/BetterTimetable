# BetterTimetable
A simple Python program that helps you track your timetable. Initially this was just a small idea I had, but I've decided to scale it up a bit adding new features over the course of time. At it's current state it's extremely basic, and doesn't even track things, yet.
## A better way to track your timetable.
BetterTimetable is made with the goal of tracking the things you do throughout the day, timetable or just a daily schedule. While it was made with timetables in mind, a future to include just tracking hobbies, exercise and pretty much anything you gotta keep track of is coming.
## The legend of Version 0.2
Some say that 0.2 would never come, contemplating, was it all just.. for nothing? Would it be left at that? Just ashes? A worse timetable? \
On a real note, I'm remaking BTT from the ground up for 0.2, reviving it and making it actually ready for the additional features such as setup and tracking, a friend of mine @LemonHeadOnGit has forked BTT and it's called PythonTracker, go check it out. https://github.com/LemonHeadOnGit/PythonPlanner
# Updated on a irregular basis
It is what it is :)
# Very Early in Development
Bugs and a *severe* lack of features should be expected.
